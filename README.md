# Gender-Recognition-by-Voice-Val.-Acc.-0.9908-
The Gender Recognition by Voice dataset from kaggle. The dataset consists of 3168 voice samples each of which has 20 different acoustic properties and the target variable is the 'gender' or the 'label'.  I have done exhaustive EDA to analyze the data and the underlying trends. Also the outliers have been detected and removed for better performance. I have also done significant feature engineering by adding couple of new relevant features. Also I have normalized the data for better performance. Lastly I have used many classification algos. from the scikit to predict the 'gender' from the voice sample.  For me SVM gives highest accuracy of about a little more than 99.1 %.
